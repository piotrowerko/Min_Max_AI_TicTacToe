This is my functional solution to the 
final stage (5/5) of project:
Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
in the "Jet Brains Academy" python developer Track.

This is the first iteration of the solution.
The code is not optimized.
However, the min_max algorithm and the rest of 
the program work perfectly fine in my opinion,
in aspect of output corretness.
